### Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:
- **Data Collection**: The project includes scripts to collect real-world apartment rental data from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data undergoes preprocessing steps to clean, transform, and prepare it for modeling.
- **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict apartment prices accurately.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
- **Visualization**: Utilizing Matplotlib, the project generates visualizations to help understand the data distribution and model outcomes.

### Getting Started
To get started with the "Apartment Price Predictor" project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the project structure and scripts to understand the implementation details.
4. Run the Python scripts to collect data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
5. Visualize the results using Matplotlib to gain insights into the apartment price predictions.

### How to Use
To utilize the apartment price predictor:
1. Load your own apartment data or use the provided sample datasets.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Train the linear regression model using Scikit-learn or a custom implementation.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
5. Make predictions on new apartment data and assess the model's accuracy.
